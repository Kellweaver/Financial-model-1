Financial Statements Project

Welcome to the Financial Statements Project repository!

This project includes two different sets of financial statements, each with its own balance sheet, income statement, and CapEx and depreciation statement.

Overview

In this project, I have created detailed financial statements for two hypothetical companies.

Each set includes the following:

Balance Sheet: A financial statement that provides a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time. It includes assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity.

Income Statement: A financial statement that shows the company's financial performance over a specific accounting period. It includes revenues, expenses, and net income.

CapEx and Depreciation Statement: A statement that outlines the company's capital expenditures (CapEx) and depreciation. It provides insights into the company's investment in long-term assets and the allocation of depreciation expenses over time.
